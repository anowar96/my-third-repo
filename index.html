    <small>An Autobiography</small>
    <h2>To the memory of my parents</h2>
    <strong>My Mother</strong>
    <pre id="b">
    Sea waves,golden sand, pilgrims' faith,
    Rameswaram Mosque Sreet, all merge into one,
    My Mother!
    You came to me like heaven's caring arms.
    I remember the war days when life was challenge and toil-
    Miles to walk, hours before sunrise,
    Walking to take lessons from the saintly teacher near the temple.
    Again miles to the Aran teaching school,
    Climb sandy hills to railway station road,
    collect, distribute newspapers to temple city citizens,
    Few hours after sunrise, going to school.
    Evening, business time before study ar night.
    All this pain of a young bou,
    My Mother you transformed into pious strenth
    With kneeling and bowing five times
    For the Grace of the Almighty only, My Mother.
    Your strong piety is your chikdres's strength,
    You always shared your best with whoever needed the most,
    You always gave, and gave with faith in Him.
    I still remember the day when I was ten,
    Sleeping on your lap to the envy of my elder brothers and sisters 
    It was full moon night, my world only you knew
    Mother! My Mother!
    When at midnight I woke with tears falling on my knee 
    You kew the pain of your child,My Mother
    Your caring hands, tenderly removing the pain
    Your live, your care, your faith gave me strength
    To face the world without fear and with His strength.
    We will meet again on the great Judgement Day, My Mother!</pre>
